# Email Deliverability Checker Script

This script aims to check the deliverability of emails listed in an SQL file. The script is flexible and can be implemented using a programming language you are most comfortable with.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this script is to validate whether email addresses from an SQL file are deliverable. It assists in identifying if the emails are formatted correctly and if the associated domains have valid MX (Mail Exchange) records, thus determining their potential deliverability.

## Implementation

1. **Choose a Programming Language:**
   Select a programming language that you are comfortable with for implementing the script. Common choices include Python, JavaScript (Node.js), or even a shell script.

2. **Read SQL File:**
   Implement code to read the SQL file and extract email addresses. Depending on the language, you might need libraries or built-in functions to parse SQL files.
   sql file: users.sql

3. **Validate Email Addresses:**
   Utilize regular expressions or built-in validation libraries to check if the extracted strings are valid email addresses according to the email format rules (e.g., `user@example.com`).

4. **DNS Lookup (MX Records):**
   For each validated email address, perform a DNS lookup to determine if the associated domain has valid MX records. This step helps to establish if the domain is capable of receiving emails.

5. **Output Results:**
   Generate a report or output detailing the status of each email address. You could categorize them as "Valid" or "Invalid" based on email format and domain MX record availability.
